### Project description

Create a clone app of Facebook using Ruby on Rails. This is a group project focused on pair programming and delivering MVP, utilizing XP principles.

### The Team:

Project created by the team: ([Ed Ancerys](https://github.com/EdAncerys), [Catriona Bennett](https://github.com/cmb84scd), [Gareth Woodman](https://github.com/GarethWoodman), [Marius Brad](https://github.com/mbrad26), [Paula Darias](https://github.com/pauladarias), [Asifur Rahman](https://github.com/aasirah93)) at Makers Academy.

## What we managed to implement

Acebook being a clone of Facebook we have added similar functionality and features.

We managed to implement the following features: **signup, signin, delete profile, able to add profile picture up on sign up or add it later on, make a post, share pictures and post them one at a time or multiple ones, like post, add friends, able to update user profile, change password, username etc.**

## Tech Stack:

- [Capybara](https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara) Capybara helps you test web applications by simulating how a real user would interact with your app.
- [RSpec](https://rspec.info/) Behaviour Driven.
  Development for Ruby. **TDD**.
- [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) Framework that allows to build modern web apps.
- [Active Record](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html) SQL back end data storage.
- [Active Storage](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html) Active Storage facilitates uploading files to a cloud storage service like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Microsoft Azure Storage and attaching those files to Active Record objects.
- [Rubocop](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop) RuboCop is a Ruby static code analyzer (a.k.a. linter) and code formatter.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) & CSS for styling.

### App deployment

- We used Travis CI
- We deployed the app using Heroku, only deploys when Travis is passing
- Visit [Honey Bunnies Acebook](https://acebook-honeybunnies.herokuapp.com/)

## Development Process

Our team used an agile development process with regular sprints to deliver this application.

We followed the Extreme Programming values - all features were pair programmed, team members shared all the changes in the code design, the team used test-driven development, and delivered an MVP in the first sprint.

We had daily stand-ups and retrospectives to update each other on the tasks completed, and reflect on our team's progress.

Ideas to improve our application

- Add feature to share posts across various platforms.
- Improve on UI elements and expand on possibility to implement UI with React.
- User profile page and friend page UI could benefit on added extra features.
